# Mobile Flashcards
A mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
Its goal is to help users memorize things. It will allow the user to create a deck to which they can add a new card where each card represents a question. The user can view the answer and then mark in the system whether or not they got the question correct. A total score is taken and on reaching the end of the deck, the user can view the percentage of correct answers they got for their current deck.
