# Mobile Flashcards
A mobile application that allows users to study collections of flashcards.
Its goal is to help users memorize things. It will allow the user to create a deck to which they can add a new card where each card represents a question. The user can view the answer and then mark in the system whether or not they got the question correct. A total score is taken and on reaching the end of the deck, the user can view the percentage of correct answers they got for their current deck.
This application was built using React native and Redux. 

## Installation
